\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:conclusion}
We created a system that enables users to design and fabricate large-scale dynamic truss structures. Our system consists of an editor, which supports creating and simulating stable truss objects with the help of a physics engine. Users can simulate motion by placing linear actuators in the structure and observe occurring forces by interactively moving the structure. Motion patterns can be created by using the keyframe animation feature. This way, the complicated motion distribution in the trusses can be thoroughly tested before building the object.\\
Our export feature enables users to generate .stl files, based on the designed object, which can be 3D printed and assembled. The animation is stored in an Arduino-readable format, so the designed object can be completely recreated in the real world.\\
For assembly, users connect PET bottles to the 3D printed hubs. An ID system clarifies which of these hubs belong together.

\section{Closed-loop Positional Control}
We already made first advances towards integrating closed-loop actuator control into our system.
