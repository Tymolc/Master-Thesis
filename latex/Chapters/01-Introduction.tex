\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:introduction}
Personal fabrication devices, such as 3D printers, are already widely used for rapid prototyping and allow non-expert users to create interactive machines, tools and art. As consumer-grade 3D printers are usually desktop-sized, the size of these objects is, however, fairly limited. \trussFabName{} aims to enable users to create large-scale dynamic objects using desktop-sized 3D printers. Scale can be achieved by creating multiple small-sized objects and connecting them to each other. If all parts of a large object would be 3D printed, this process would take a long time. Our solution to this problem is to take ready-made objects, like empty plastic bottles and only print the connectors that keep them together.
